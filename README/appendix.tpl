Required APIs
=============
For the Artifact Registry to deploy, the following APIs should be enabled in your project:
 * `iam.googleapis.com`
 * `artifactregistry.googleapis.com`

Testing
=======
This module comes with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) scripts for both unit testing and integration testing.
A Makefile is provided to run the tests using docker, but you can also run the tests directly on your machine if you have terratest installed.

### Run with make
Make sure to set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT to the right project and GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS to the right credentials json file
You can now run the tests with docker:
```
make test
```

### Run locally
From the module directory, run:
```
cd test && TF_VAR_owner=$(id -nu) go test
```
